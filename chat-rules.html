  <h1>Chat Rules</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Chat! This space is designed to provide you with guidance, motivation, and support on your fitness journey.

        <strong>Provide Context</strong>: When engaging with our Coaches in the chat, begin by giving a brief but comprehensive overview of your fitness / sleep / well-being journey. Share relevant details about your current health level, fitness level, eating habits, any specific challenges you're facing, and your ultimate goals. The more context our Coaches have, the better they can tailor their advice to your individual circumstances.
