<h1>Subscription Terms</h1>
<p>
  <strong>1. Free trial</strong>

<p>
  <strong>2. Subscription</strong>
</p>
<p>The subscription begins from the first payment and renews automatically at the end of each period (each week, month, 6 months, year, or otherwise, depending on the option selected by you at the time of purchase) until you cancel.</p>

  <strong>3. Payment method</strong>

  <strong>4. Cancellation</strong>

<p>Canceling your subscription means that the automatic renewal will be disabled, but you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of your then-current period. Note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscriptions.</p>
