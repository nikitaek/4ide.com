    <strong>9. FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt-out, and requires us to disclose what personal information we have collected, used, and shared over the last 12 months.</p>
  <p>Section 2 describes the personal information we have collected about you, including the sources of that information. We collect this information for the purposes described in Section 3. We share this information as described in Section 5.</p>
  <p>Under CCPA you as a California resident have the following rights, which you may exercise by yourself or you may designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Right of Know.</strong> You have the right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we collect, use, or disclose.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Right to Delete.</strong> You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we have collected from you.
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
    <strong>Right to Opt-Out.</strong> CCPA requires that we maintain a separate webpage that allows you to opt out of the sale of your personal information, which can be accessed by clicking the <a href="https://madmuscles.com/en/do-not-sell-my-personal-information">link</a>.
  </p> -->
  <p>
    <strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these rights. We will not deny you our services, charge you different prices, or provide you a lower quality of services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.
  </p>
  <p>You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under the CCPA. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
  <p>To exercise any of your privacy rights, please send a request to 4idecom@gmail.com. </p>
  <p>California’s Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies once a year what personal information they share with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. Learn more about what is considered to be <a href="http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;amp;sectionNum=1798.81.5">personal information under the statute</a>. </p>

    <strong>10. DATA RETENTION</strong>
  </p>
  <p>We will store your personal data for as long as it is reasonably necessary for achieving the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy (including providing the Service to you), which includes (but is not limited to) the period during which you have an account with the Website.

  <p>
    <strong>11. HOW “DO NOT TRACK” REQUESTS ARE HANDLED</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT preference. You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.</p>
  <p>We currently do not support “Do Not Track” requests because no DNT standard has been adopted.</p>
  <p>Our third-party services may collect information about you and your online activities over time and across our Services and other online properties. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. To determine whether any of the third-party services honor the “Do Not Track” requests, please read their privacy policies.</p>
